            On June 26, 2020, Beahm was banned from Twitch for unexplained reasons and his channel was removed from the site. Sources have reported that the ban is permanent. He returned to streaming on August 7, 2020, on YouTube with a total peak of more than 510,000 concurrent viewers.</p>

            Beahm's on-stream persona is usually ruthless, quick-witted, and bombastic. He is often regarded as an entertainer in the streaming industry, rather than a "professional gamer." ESPN describes him as "a WWE character in the competitive gaming world", and he has himself said "I created a character who plays multiplayer video games, and he's considered the most dominating gaming specimen."
